# Getting Started in the tutorial environment

## Github: register and find the repository

1. Make sure you have an account [on Github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github#signing-up-for-a-new-personal-account). You will have to verify your email.
2. Next, navigate to this lesson repository: [terminal-sync-vscode](https://github.com/NAHLN/terminal-sync-vscode) and find the green button that says <b><> Code</b>.

3. Click on that button for the pulldown box. If you are logged in, you will see a "CODESPACES" tab.
4. Find <b>obscure doodle</b> and click.

Once you click, it will take a minute or so to get started up, so sit back and watch!

### Launching the Codespace means launching VS Code! (described below)

As the codespace starts running, VS Code also initializes.

Here is a screenshot:

If you are not familiar with VS Code, see the section below to get oriented.  If you are, you can skip ahead to the next section.

## VS Code: quick overview

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is a free-to-use IDE (code editor with tools).  The version we use will launch in the github window, so no installation required.

It is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and has several great tools integrated with the editor, such as a file browser, debugger, and importantly, **its own terminal!**

### VS Code window panes

See this [Get Started guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) for videos and more information.

* **A. Activity Bar** - Located on the far left-hand side. Loads "views" (like the File Explorer) into the **Primary Side Bar**. Icons launch the different views.
* **B. Primary Side Bar** - Contains different views (like the File Explorer) to assist you while working on your project.
* **C. Editor Group Pane** - The main area to edit and view files. Can contain multiple tabs or split windows side-by-side.
* **D. Panel** - Additional "Views" with key controls like the **Terminal**.
* **E. Status Bar** - Information about the project, codespace and files.
* **F. Command Palette** - Certain functions can be run from here. This is more advanced.

## Github codespaces: launch the learning environment

The learning environment will be a lightweight cloud computing setting that will be the same for everyone, and most similar to a server you may encounter in HPC.  We will use this setting for basic tutorials.
